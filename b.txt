We are pleased to announce a 2-Month Internship Program for BE/ME/MCA Students in "Data Science using Python", being organized and hosted at COEP‚Äôs Bhau Institute of Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Leadership, College of Engineering, Pune from 8th June - 28th July 2019.

There will be 12 systematic training sessions of 3-hours each (contents attached) + a project in a group of 4-5 students which would be mentored by people from industry. CLASSES will be held only on Saturdays and Sundays. All these sessions will be telecasted ONLINE LIVE for students outside Pune via webinar mode.

Pre-requisite: NONE (except an interest in Data Science, non-fear of Maths & coding). Participants are expected to bring their own laptops for the hands-on sessions. The training sessions will be conducted by Mr. Prashant Sahu, CEO of Tech Smart Systems, and a machine learning & deep learning algorithms expert. He is also pursuing PhD from IIT Bombay.
 
The Internship training sessions contents have been attached as PDF File.

The main highlights of this internship course are:
This is going to be much more comprehensive than short-cut 3-day or 5-day workshops.
This is the most extensive hands-on session ever offered in Pune for academia.
Clear algorithm explanations that help you to understand the principles that underlie each technique.
Quick mathematical primer for each algorithm on white-board to show you exactly how each model learns.
Real worked examples so that you can see exactly the numbers in and the numbers out, there‚Äôs nowhere for the details to hide.

Please forward this email to all your faculty friends and students who would be interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning domain. If you also wish to organize such workshops/internship programs in your college, please feel free to contact us.

The final score will be featured to each student upon completion of the examination. Students who score below the passing score (65%) can apply for a second attempt after a gap of one month.

 

It is a unique opportunity for students to move their careers forward, with Infosys. Kindly spread the word among your students to REGISTER NOW and book the examination date and city of their choice. The registrations will be accepted on first come, first served basis.

6/25/19, 10:23 AM - +91 96230 14411: Dear Prof.Swati More,

 

My colleague Yeshwant has been in touch with you about the scholarship for students of P.E.S's Mordern P.E.S. Modern College of Engineering, Pune, Maharashtra on our Internet of  Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) training program. I thought of writing to you myself about the same.

 

We have selected a few prestigious colleges from India as part of this program, and I am happy to say that your institute is one of them. This scholarship program is in continuation of the student partner internship program for which we had selected students from your institute. Your efforts as the faculty, along with the intern's performance, has put P.E.S's Mordern P.E.S. Modern College of Engineering in this top list.

 

TODAY, 25th of June 2019 is the LAST DAY to apply for the scholarship.

 

Many of the students wait for the last moment to apply for such scholarship programs; hence, I request to remind your students about the same if not yet done. Students have to visit https://shop.boltiot.com/pages/scholarship to answer the scholarship test.

 

For any queries, you could reply to this E-Mail or call me on (+91)7020581998.

 

My apologies for sending the second follow-up. Hopefully, we are not spamming your mailbox. We hope to have a fruitful relationship with your college in the coming months.

 

Regards,
Pranav Pai Vernekar
CEO - Bolt IoT

In the wake of energy sustainability and mitigating climate change, the idea of ‚ÄúEnergy Swaraj‚Äù or localized energy self-sufficiency has been conceptualized. Gandhi Global Solar Yatra (GGSY, www.ggsy.in) is planned by IIT Bombay not only in India but across the globe.

A culmination event of this Yatra, the Students Solar Ambassador Workshop, is being organized by IIT Bombay on 2nd Oct. 2019, wherein hands-on training will be given to students to make their own solar study lamp. A similar workshop was also organized last year, wherein more than 1.30 lakh students assembled their own solar study lamps all over India, which was also a Guinness World Record event.

Our college, Modern College of Engineering, will be participating in this global event and every participant will get certificate of the participation. Every registered student will get a working solar study lamp kit which costs about 550 rupees. In the workshop, students will assemble the lamp and students can take their lamps home for their own use. Cost will be paid by student.

If you are interested, please register your name at the link below by tomorrow 19th July morning, as our college will be sending the list of the names for this workshop.

Workshop will be held at our college only at suitable time and this activity will be of about 2 hour duration at your suitable time.

In the wake of energy sustainability and mitigating climate change, the idea of ‚ÄúEnergy Swaraj‚Äù or localized energy self-sufficiency has been conceptualized. Gandhi Global Solar Yatra (GGSY, www.ggsy.in) is planned by IIT Bombay not only in India but across the globe.

A culmination event of this Yatra, the Students Solar Ambassador Workshop, is being organized by IIT Bombay on 2nd Oct. 2019, wherein hands-on training will be given to students to make their own solar study lamp. A similar workshop was also organized last year, wherein more than 1.30 lakh students assembled their own solar study lamps all over India, which was also a Guinness World Record event.

Our college, Modern College of Engineering, will be participating in this global event and every participant will get certificate of the participation. Every registered student will get a working solar study lamp kit which costs about 550 rupees. In the workshop, students will assemble the lamp and students can take their lamps home for their own use. Cost will be paid by student.

If you are interested, please register your name at the link below by today (23rd July) afternoon, as our college will be sending the list of the names for this workshop soon.

Workshop will be held at our college only at suitable time and this activity will be of about 2 hour duration at your suitable time.

Hi Nitin, 

Sorry for communication gap. I and Swati Ma'am have agreed to following 
All students who show interest in eLitmus pH Test will be credited eLitmus cash of 500 
They can use it to buy gift cards and then actually see its benefits
This way they will have confidence to understand that eLitmus is actually not trying to make any money from test but will make it from companies
Balance money whatever they have paid us will be credited as eLitmus cash after they take the test. The clear understanding is that candidate should use eLitmus cash only if s/he intends to take the pH Test

We have already being told that we directly are supposed to come on the 31st next then why are we given this last minute assignments and tests which weren't mentioned a single time before? Not many will speak up about this here but I am sure nobody has an ounce of will left to do this work after we feel that our submissions are already over and this is our time to prepare for our practicals. I do not mean to offend you in any way but we really do need this time to prepare and I strongly urge you to reconsider this.

10/22/19, 6:06 PM - +91 99239 09559: The tests were as well scheduled already in the term when mass bunk were observed.
10/22/19, 6:07 PM - Rohan Mcoe: Agreed... we have already rescheduled our diwali plans accordingly and being asked to come to college more times for tests which could've been done well before... We're literally spending the whole day in college doing these and getting more assignments when we get home...
10/22/19, 6:08 PM - Viren Mcoe: I have asked around and nobody says so. We have done all other submissions as and when we were asked. No reason why we wouldn't have done these. Nobody knew about these tests.
10/22/19, 6:08 PM - Chaitrali Mcoe: Exactly...
10/22/19, 6:08 PM - +91 99239 09559: I am also not at interested in assignments submission after term end.
10/22/19, 6:10 PM - +91 99239 09559: OK fine, all files are corrected and submission is finished it seems. I am the only one who is waiting for you people. Sorry for reminding.
10/22/19, 6:10 PM - Rohan Mcoe: And even if they were, and if we were absent whilst, they could've been forwarded here quite a while ago... Not when the practicals are a week away and holidays are starting...
10/22/19, 6:15 PM - Sujal Mcoe: We do not mean to offend you ma'am we are just trying to say that we have just few days left for the practical exams and we need this time to prepare for the same üôà

Subject: 
*What is the Corona/ Covid-19 Virus Really Teaching us?*
¬†
I‚Äôm a strong believer that there is a spiritual purpose behind everything that happens, whether that is what we perceive as being good or being bad.

As I meditate upon this, I want to share with you what I feel the Corona/ Covid-19 virus is really doing to us:

1) It is reminding us that we are all equal, regardless of our culture, religion, occupation, financial situation or how famous we are. This disease treats us all equally, perhaps we should to. If you don‚Äôt believe me,
 just ask Tom Hanks.

2) It is reminding us that we are all connected and something that affects one person has an effect on another. It is reminding us that the false borders that we have put up have little value as this virus does not need a passport. It is reminding us, by oppressing us for a short time, of those in this world whose whole life is spent in oppression.

3) It is reminding us of how precious our health is and how we have moved to neglect it through eating nutrient poor manufactured food and drinking water that is contaminated with chemicals upon chemicals. If we don‚Äôt look after our health, we will, of course, get sick.

4) It is reminding us of the shortness of life and of what is most important for us to do, which is to help each other, especially those who are old or sick. Our purpose is not to buy toilet roll.

5) It is reminding us of how materialistic our society has become and how, when in times of difficulty, we remember that it‚Äôs the essentials that we need (food, water, medicine)
 as opposed to the luxuries that we sometimes unnecessarily give value to.

6) It is reminding us of how important our family and home life is and how much we have neglected this. It is forcing us back into our houses so we can rebuild them into our home and
 to strengthen our family unit.

7) It is reminding us that our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do.
Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another.

8) It is reminding us to keep our egos in check. It is reminding us that no matter how great we think we are or how great others think we are,
a virus can bring our world to a standstill.

9) It is reminding us that the power of freewill is in our hands. We can choose to cooperate and help each other, to share, to give, to help and to support each other or we can choose to be selfish, to hoard, to look after
 only our self. Indeed, it is difficulties that bring out our true colors.

10) It is reminding us that we can be patient, or we can panic. We can either understand that this type of situation has happened many times before in history and will pass, or we can panic and see it as the end of the world and, consequently, cause ourselves more harm than good.

11) It is reminding us that this can either be an end or a new beginning. This can be a time of reflection and understanding, where we learn from our mistakes, or it can be the start of a cycle which will continue until we finally learn the lesson we are meant to.

12) It is reminding us that this Earth is sick. It is reminding us that we need to look at the rate of deforestation just as urgently as we look at the speed at which toilet rolls are disappearing off of shelves. We are sick because our home is sick.¬†

13) It is reminding us that after every difficulty, there is always ease. Life is cyclical, and this is just a phase in this great cycle. We do not need to panic; this too shall pass.

14) Whereas many see the Corona/ Covid-19 virus as a great disaster, I prefer to see it as a *great corrector*

It is sent to remind us of the important lessons that we seem to have forgotten and it is up to us if we will learn them or not.

There they required to enter candidate ID which is not there with the students. I just spoke with HR infosys so he said, students might have rcvd an email few days or moths b4 regarding it and it might have been in to spam folder. If it is not there, then pls ask them to wait ,as they will rcv it from company. 
They need to enter correct candidate ID.

Also about document verification, there are queries from many students , but document verification is not for all, its generally for border line cases. 

HR requested to post me in this group, so I am posting. 

Thank you.

9/10/20, 4:50 PM - +91 96230 14411: This is¬†Farooq¬†from Whitehat Jr. I am¬†writing to you with regard to a potential¬†placements¬†partnership¬†with us.¬†Whitehat Jr. is looking to onboard interested candidates from your esteemed institution to be a part of our valuable Educator team. The candidates would be a crucial part of a global, emerging education market and would be responsible for teaching and mentoring the students enrolled on our platform remotely from the comforts of their home at their own convenient time.¬†Currently, we are looking at onboarding about 5000+ Teachers on our platform to cater to the global ed-tech industry.

¬†
The current pool of candidates that work with us shows a potential and earning¬†capacity between INR¬†50,000/-¬†to¬†Rs.100,000/-¬†every month with a commitment of time starting from just 30 hours a week.


We are already in discussion with other institutes like Amity, LPU to help provide students the opportunity to be self-employed and independent in the present COVID - 19 situation¬†and wanted to understand from you on how can we partner together to place your current year BCA/MCA graduates and previous alumnis in this role.


I would like to discuss this with you in a more detailed manner and if this is something you believe you would be keen on taking up, please do let me know and we can get on a call to take this ahead.


I have added a couple of video links below that talk about our platform and the experience of our teachers and students and also the JD and Introduction deck for your reference.
